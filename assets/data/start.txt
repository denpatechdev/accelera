???[|SetBGM,assets/music/Chords.m4a;SetBG,assets/images/delusion.png]:Delusion.
???[|]:Psychosis.
???[|]:Irrationality.
???[|]:Those are the words I can use to explain the recent events.
???[|]:The world has benefited heavily from technoaccelerationism.
???[|]:Many advances have made life better.
???[|]:But it's all a dystopia. It's a facade. A mimicry of a impossible, perfect world.
???[.2|SetBranch,day-start]:Today is the day you wake up, Fuka.
///day-start
Fuka[.2|SetBGM,assets/music/cozy/Cuddle Clouds.mp3;SetBG,assets/images/awake.png]:Good morning.
Mona[|]:Good morning, darling. Did you know I love you very very very much?
Fuka[|]:Hehe...with how much you tell me that, of course I do!
Fuka[|]:What day is it today?
Mona[|]:Hmmm... I'm not sure, but that's what we have ARUDEBAISU for anyways
Mona[|]:I always get surprised that the only things that aren't robots in our house are us. Everything is automated now.
Mona[|]:It wasn't like this just 5 years ago.
Fuka[|]:You're right.
Fuka[|]:What day is it, ARUDEBAISU?
ARUDEBAISU[|]:It is Saturday, the 25th of November 2044. It is 10:37 AM.
Fuka[|]:I wanna stay in bed but...
Fuka[|]:I should get up, it's well into the morning.
Mona[|]:I'll rest a little more...
...[|]:Fuka gets up and goes to the bathroom.
Fuka[.2|SetBG,assets/images/bathroom.png]:...?
Fuka[|]:Nevermind.
...[|]:Fuka splashes her face with water.
Fuka[|]:Something feels off today.
Fuka[|]:I don't know what it is. I just feel a little weird.
Fuka[|]:I'm not the most mentally sound, so I guess it isn't that weird I feel like this.
...[|]:Fuka brushes her teeth.
...[|]:...
...[|]:Fuka spits.
...[|]:...
Fuka[|SetBG,assets/images/shower.png]:Now for a shower...
Fuka[|]:...
Fuka[|]:I still feel odd...
Fuka[|]:I feel this weird aura in my head...
Fuka[|]:...My head... my head... my head...
Fuka[|SetBG,assets/images/shower_insane.png;SetBGM,assets/music/Chords.m4a]:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Fuka[|]:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Fuka[|]:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Fuka[|]:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
???[0.2|SetBG,assets/images/delusion.png]:Hello, Fuka.
???[|]:You haven't waken up yet, have you?
???[|]:The sooner you realize, the better.
???[|]:Your life, the world, will all be better once you wake up.
...[|]:...
Mona[|SetBG,assets/images/awake.png]:Honey? Are you zoning out again?
Mona[|]:Honey?
Fuka[|]:Agh!
Fuka[|SetBGM,assets/music/cozy/Cuddle Clouds.mp3]:Sorry... I'm not sure what happened.
Mona[|]:It's alright, honey. You didn't have dinner yesterday and you slept late, so it might just be that.
Mona[|]:I'm going to make your favorite for breakfast.
Mona[|]:Well, make it if selecting it on ARUCOOK counts as making food.
Mona[|]:Bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages and toast with jam.
Mona[|]:So, lets get out of bed, shall we?
Fuka[|]:Yeah.
...[|SetBG,assets/images/bathroom.png]:Fuka goes to the bathroom...
...[|]:...Brushes her teeth...
...[|SetBG,assets/images/shower.png]:...And takes a shower...
...[|]:...With a sense of slight paranoia enveloping her.
...[|]:"What if that happens again?"
...[|]:...Luckily for her, it didn't.
...[|]:Fuka finishes her shower, puts on fresh clothes, and goes to the dining room.
Mona[|SetBG,assets/images/food.png]:Here's your food, darling!
Fuka[|]:Thank you. I love you so much.
Mona[|]:I love you too.
...[|]:Fuka eats her breakfast.
Fuka[|]:It was delicious. Your ability to finetune ARUCOOK is amazing.
Mona[|]:Practice makes perfect!
Fuka[|]:Do we have groceries?
Mona[|]:Let me check...
Mona[|]:We're running out. Do you want me to go get groceries?
Fuka[|]:No, it's fine. I'll go myself.
Mona[|]:Are you sure? You've been zoning out more often these past few days.
Fuka[|]:I'll be fine, don't worry.
Mona[|]:If you say so.
...[|]:Fuka takes her wallet.
...[|SetBG,assets/images/door.png]:Fuka faces the door...
...[|SetBG,assets/images/init.png]:...And goes outside.
Fuka[|]:...
Fuka[|]:I wonder what all these episodes are.
Fuka[|]:Why are they happening?
Fuka[|]:Strange dreams too...
Fuka[|]:Flower smells for $3... I should get Mona some.
Fuka[|]:Let me get my wallet out.
???[.2|SetBG,assets/images/init_insane.png]:...
...[|SetBG,assets/images/attack.png;SetBGM,assets/music/DarkForest.m4a]:Fuka's head gets bashed into the wall, leaving a trail of blood.
Fuka[|]:WHAT THE FUCK!
Fuka[|]:HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT HURTS
Fuka[|SetBG,assets/images/wake_up.png]:Who the fuck are you? Why did you do that
???[|]:I needed to make you wake you up.
???[|Choice,Wake up,realization;Choice,Don't wake up,main]:You need to wake up.
///realization
...[|SetBG,assets/images/awake.png]:Fuka wakes up at home.
Fuka[|]:Fuck...
Fuka[|]:Huh... I'm home?
Fuka[|]:I'm still bleeding, shit.
Fuka[|]:Mona?
Fuka[|]:Mona??
Mona[.2|]:CHIP RESTARTING...

...[|]:... 
Fuka[|]:I'm awake now. I get it now.
Fuka[|]:This isn't real. This love wasn't ever real. It's artificial. It's fake. It's manufactured. My memories too.
Fuka[|]:I feel............................so sick.
Fuka[|]:I'm a needy girl... I can't do anything if Mona isn't here...
Fuka[|]:And she'll never be, because she never even was real.
Fuka[|]:She was just a fucking chip in my head.
Fuka[|]:...
